### Issues and Planned Features

- `Feature: Establish actual cryptocurrency`: Explore possibility of converting robcoin from pseudo to actual cryptocurrency

## Development Process

The development of this app will benefit greatly from lessons learned during my last project in which technical issues were allowed to derail the project timeline.

1) The user stories for the full version of this are as follows:
  - As a user, I want to be able to:
    - Create a user account;
    - Open a Robcoin account;
    - See my current account balance;
    - See my account transaction history;
    - See how much my Robcoin is worth in USD or Euros;
    - Select other foreign currencies to compare against;
    - See a chart of my balance history;
    - Register a deposit or withdrawal;
    - Perform standard user authentication (sign-in, sign-out, etc.)
2) Project wireframes and ERD documentation can be found here https://github.com/Frinkiac-7/robcoin-client/tree/master/project_docs
3) The project timeline for MVP completion is as follows:
  - Day 1: Start user and account management APIs
  - Day 2: Complete user & account management, start data model
  - Day 3: Complete data model, start front-end
  - Day 4: Complete front-end, complete deployment and requirements testing
  - Day 5: Pray and present
